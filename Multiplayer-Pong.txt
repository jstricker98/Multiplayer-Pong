Source code for Pong with Local multiplayer using Turtle
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-pong-game-using-python-turtle/

GOAL:
remove the local multiplayer from the source code and add the ability for a host and
client to play pong with one another via internet connection.

Current Status:
currently the game is able to connect the Host and Client and then open up a game view
for both players. The 'W' and 'S' key controls the assigned paddle of the player. Host
is assigned to the paddle on the left and the client controls the paddle on the right.

To Do:
Sync up the game views so that both player see the same thing on their windows.
This includes: paddle position of both players, ball position, and player scores.
